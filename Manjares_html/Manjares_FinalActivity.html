<p><strong>Vergil</strong> is the older twin brother of <i>Dante</i> and one of the main antagonists of the <em>Devil May Cry</em> franchise. Following the death of their mother as children, <strong>Vergil</strong> and <i>Dante</i> went their separate ways, with <strong>Vergil</strong> rejecting his humanity and embracing his demonic heritage, in contrast with his younger brother's embrace of humanity and initial rejection of the demonic. Stoic and reserved, <strong>Vergil</strong> displays a willingness to do anything in his quest to obtain the power of his father, Sparda.
