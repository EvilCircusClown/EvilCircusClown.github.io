<h1>MARGINOCEPHALIANS</h1>

<p>
Marginocephalia is a clade of ornithischian dinosaurs that is characterized by a bony shelf or margin at the
back of the skull. These fringes were likely used for display. There are two clades included in Marginocephalia:
the thick-skulled Pachycephalosauria and the horned Ceratopsia.
All members of Marginocephalia were primarily herbivores (though pachycephalosaurs are speculated to have been
omnivorous). They basally used gastroliths to aid in digestion of tough plant matter until they
convergently evolved tooth batteries in Neoceratopsia (or "new Ceratopsia") and Pachycephalosauria.
Marginocephalia first evolved in the Jurassic Period and became more common in the Cretaceous.
They are basally small facultative quadrupeds while derived members of the group are large obligate quadrupeds.
Primitive marginocephalians are found in Asia, but the group migrated upwards into North America.
