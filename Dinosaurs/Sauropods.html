<h1>SAUROPODS</h1>
</a>
<p>
Sauropoda, whose members are known as sauropods), is a clade of saurischian ('lizard-hipped') dinosaurs.
Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads (relative to the rest of their body), and four thick,
pillar-like legs.
They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the
largest animals to have ever lived on land.
Well-known genera include Apatosaurus, Argentinosaurus, Alamosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus, and Mamenchisaurus.
