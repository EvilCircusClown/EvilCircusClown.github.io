<h1>THEROPODS</h1>
</a>
<p>
Theropoda whose members are known as theropods, is a dinosaur clade that is characterized by hollow bones and
three toes and claws on each limb. Theropods are generally classed as a group of saurischian dinosaurs.
They were ancestrally carnivorous, although a number of theropod groups evolved to become herbivores and
omnivores. Theropods first appeared during the Carnian age of the late Triassic period 231.4 million years ago
and included the majority of large terrestrial carnivores from the Early Jurassic until at least the close of
the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma. In the Jurassic, birds evolved from small specialized coelurosaurian theropods,
and are today represented by about 11,000 living species.
